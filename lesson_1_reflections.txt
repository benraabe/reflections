I saw the place where I did edits. With that it was easier to spot the bug,
since it could have been only in my last edits.

I can see the dependencies better.

The commits can be put at logical places

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
- because in coding files are highly interdependent

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
- by showing all commits and comparing them

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
-It is easier to reverse
